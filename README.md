# FinalProjectCopy

This was an assignment required by NYCDA

It required the following: 

"This assignment will be the beginning of a larger project. In the end you will have a multi-page personal website! Today you will complete the first page called "About Me". This page will be you introducing yourself to the world so think about what information you want to share. Are you wanting to be a Web Developer? Start your portfolio site and introduce yourself as a developer! Are you a current Graphic Designer and want to create your own site? Introduce yourself as a designer learning to code! Whatever the theme is be sure to represent yourself well and have fun. Take a look at what others are doing to get inspiration. Siteinspire.com is a great resource for modern design trends and hints to get you started. Share a photo and tell us a little more about who you are. Remember you can always change and update this page later, this assigment is to demonstrate you have the basics down first."
